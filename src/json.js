			"text":"You and your older sister Hannah are at your grandparents' summer house on Lake Champlain in Vermont. You visit the lake every summer, but this year is special. You have decided to spend your visit searching for Champ, a sea creature who lives in the lake. Many people have spotted Champ over the years. They say that Champ has a big head covered in scales, a slender neck, and a long, snakelike body. Champ has never attacked anyone. Scientists believe that Champ is very gentle and shy. In fact, Champ is so shy that no one has ever gotten a photograph of her. Maybe you and Hannah will be the first! It is a warm sunny day with only a few clouds in the sky. It's a perfect day to begin an adventure. You put on your life jackets, grab the camera, and head for canoe. As you look across the lack, you realize that searching for Champ is going to be a big job! 'Where do you want to go first?'Hannah asks. 'We could go to Shelburne Point, where some people saw Champ last summer, or we could head up toward Grande Isle.' 'Grand Isle might be better because there are lots of quiet, deep coves there. Remember, Champ is very shy.",

In 15 minutes you can see the famous house on the point. ‘Should we head for the house and look around, or drift around a while and look for Champ?’  ‘Let's drift for a while,’ Hannah suggests. ‘It might be a good time to try out your bait.’ ’Good idea.’ You reach for a wire basket tied to a fishing line. Inside the wire basket are some large, fresh shrimp. Last year some picnickers saw Champ in a spot where they had dropped some shrimp salad out of their boat. You figure it's worth a try. After gently letting the basket overboard, you lean back and close your eyes. The sun beats down on your bare arms. Hannah hums quietly to herself. Several minutes later jolting awake, you look overboard. The water is so dark that it begins to feel a little mysterious. You can't see anything, and you realize that you haven't had any luck yet and you start to get a little restless. ‘Should we sit and wait for just a few more minutes?’ I asked Hannah. ‘I say we go up to the house and look around.’ She replies.",

			"text":"You and Hannah head the canoe toward Grand Isle. Out on the lake the waves are high. Your arms begin to ache from paddling, but all you can think about is getting safely across the rough waters and finding Champ. After 30 minutes of hard paddling you are close to Grand Isle. When you are 50 feet from shore you see an old abandoned house tucked beside a quiet cove. That's funny, you think. You've never noticed it before. ‘Wow!’ Hannah shouts. ‘It looks like a haunted house. ‘As she speaks, a cloud passes in front of the sun. ‘Hey, Hannah!’ you say. ‘Let's go in and explore the place. ‘Okay. I'm getting tired anyway.’ You continue paddling, and after a few minutes you pull the canoe up on the sandy shore. As you walk toward the house, a chilly wind rises. You hear a long, eerie screech. An old shutter on the second story of the house breaks off. It tumbles through the air and lands right in front of you! You and Hannah look at each other. ‘This place gives me the creeps,’ you say. ‘It was just the wind, ‘ Hannah says. ‘The house isn't haunted. That's only in the movies.’",

Why don't we build a sand castle instead?’ Hannah nods and the two of you choose a good spot and begin work. You lose track of time. A half hour passes before you notice the house is creaking in a strong wind. The skies are cloudy and dark. Thunder rumbles in the distance. A thunderstorm will start any minute. You must do something and fast!",

You stumble into a dusty hallway. ‘Hannah, it looks as if no one has been here for years!’ ‘I know,’ she says. ‘Let's give it a look.' You decide to wait before bringing up the basket of shrimp. Champ scares easily. You don't want to frighten her off. After a few minutes, there are no more tugs. You lean back against your cushion and doze. Hannah's voice awakens you. ‘It looks like a storm. Don't you think we had better head in?’ ‘You're right. We can use the dock at Shelburne Point. That's closest.’ As you paddle on, the rain starts to fall. Soon the lake is smooth from the steady pounding of the rain. It look eerie and beautiful. The boats have all gone in to shelter, and you are alone on the lake. You tiptoe carefully from room to room. There are pieces of broken furniture, an old bird's nest, and lots of dust. ‘There's nothing here. Let's go.’ ‘Wait, Hannah. Look at this.’ You point to a narrow staircase behind a kitchen door. ‘This looks safe. Let's explore upstairs.’ Hannah follows you up the dark, narrow staircase. It leads to a stuffy room. You carefully look through the closet and a chest of drawers. There's nothing else but a moth-eaten bed. But wait! Hannah lifts up the mattress and finds a wooden box underneath. She tries to open it, but the box is locked! You wonder what's inside.",

Hannah looks at the dripping basket and says, ‘It was probably just a fish.'  You refill the basket with shrimp and put it back into the lake.  Hannah says, 'We'd better get going, anyway. There's a storm coming.'  Sure enough, the sky is filling with dark - heavy clouds. You point your canoe toward home and paddle with all your strength. The wind howls and the lake gets choppy and rough.  ‘This is dangerous Hannah. If the waves get a higher, we'll be swamped!’ ‘But we're almost home!’ Hannah yells. You peer ahead, but you still can't see the dock. Then you glance at the shore. It looks rocky, but you really want to get a picture of Champ. ‘It's getting too rough, Hannah! We might have to go in now!’ You can barely hear your own voice over the wind, but Hannah nods and begins to steer the canoe toward shore. The wind is at your back. It helps to push you along. You are almost there when you feel a tug on the basket in the water.",

You've never seem such a bad storm. The waves toss you about, and you are scared. A pool of water is forming in the bottom of your canoe. A big wave then another comes crashing into the boat. You're swamped. Just as you're about to give up, a huge figure dressed in flowing white robes appears out of the clouds. ‘I am a goddess, and this lake is my home. When I started this storm, I did not see you and your sister alone in your canoe. Do not worry. I will take you to shore myself.’ With that, she scoops up your canoe in the palm of her hand and, smiling, deposits you safely at your dock. Before you can catch your breath to thank her, she disappears into the clouds, leaving a stream of brilliant pink light behind her.",

As you pass a window, you catch a glimpse of a small head, and two feet coming out of the water, looking curiously at the house. ‘It's Champ!’ When you get outside, Champ leans her head back and cries, ‘Yaaooooo! Yaaooooo,’ in a thin, high-pitched voice. Six more creatures of different sizes appear in the cove. They stare at you and Hannah for several moments. Then Champ makes another cry, and all seven disappear together, back under the surface of the water.",

You keep paddling, but the lake is so rough that you aren't getting anywhere. The canoe drifts dangerously close to shore. Then there is a sudden crack—the loudest you have ever heard—and a flash of light. You are thrown from the boat. You feel a sharp pain where you hit your head on something hard. Then... nothing. You wake up on the shore. The storm has passed. The sun is peeking through the clouds. Hannah is lying next to you, and the canoe is nearby, wedged between two rocks. You don't remember exactly what happened. After you hit your head, you felt as if you were in a dream. You were floating face down in the water and couldn't move. Then, out of nowhere, an enormous creature that looked like a cross between a dinosaur and a seal lifted you onto its back and swam to shore. It left you safely on the shore. You turned to see the creature before it left. All you saw was a big head with large blinking eyes. Was it Champ? Or were you dreaming? Hannah is awake now, too. Rubbing her eyes, she says, 'You know, I think we were saved. Did you see something that looked like a huge seal bring you to shore too?' A happy shiver races down your spine. Maybe you weren't dreaming after all!",

GET A PICTURE!’ There, right where your canoe went down, is Champ, playing in the storm. She dives in and out of the waves, splashing you with her tail. You snap 24 pictures in all.
